# **Week 5: IO Programming**

Welcome to the repository for Week 5 of our Java learning journey. This week focused on advanced input/output programming in Java, covering data handling formats like CSV and JSON, as well as powerful language features such as annotations, reflection, and design principles.

## **Overview**

This week emphasized the importance of data exchange and structural introspection in Java. We explored how to read from and write to CSV and JSON files using libraries and standard APIs. We also introduced Java annotations and reflection as tools for meta-programming, and covered core software design principles to build robust and maintainable applications.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Day 1: CSV Data Handling**

* Introduction to CSV format  
* Reading and writing CSV files using core Java  
* Using third-party libraries like OpenCSV  
* Handling special characters and delimiters  
* Best practices for CSV parsing  

### **Day 2: JSON Data**

* Introduction to JSON structure  
* Reading and writing JSON in Java  
* Using libraries like Jackson or Gson  
* Serializing and deserializing Java objects  
* Managing nested and complex JSON structures  

### **Day 3: Annotations, Reflection, and Design Principles**

* What are annotations and how to use them  
* Built-in vs. custom annotations  
* Introduction to Java reflection API  
* Accessing class metadata and invoking methods dynamically  
* Overview of key design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)  

## **Prerequisites**

* Completion of Week 4: Java Collections and Streams  
* Familiarity with file handling and Java classes  
* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
* A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  

## **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## **Next Steps**

In the upcoming weeks, we will explore application development using frameworks like Spring Boot, building RESTful services, and deploying Java applications. Keep experimenting and applying your knowledge to real-world scenarios!
